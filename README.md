# Sadquencer

Hi!

We were tasked with making a useless website, so I made an instrument that sounds kinda bad.

Not yet safari-proof, so I would recommend running this in chrome or firefox.

Instructions on how to use the instrument are found on the site, [enjoy!](https://sadquencer.vercel.app/)

## Features to add

- A proper scale picker.

## Testers

[Dante Mogrim](https://github.com/mogrim-91) and [Rikard Segerkvist](https://github.com/rikardseg)
